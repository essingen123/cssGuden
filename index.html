    <h3>What are their needs and pain points?</h3>
    <p>An easy-to-use CSS library that can help them create a modern and responsive design without having to start from scratch.</p>
    <h3>What are the current trends and best practices in web design?</h3>
    <p>Modular and flexible design, responsive design, and a focus on user experience.</p>
    <h3>How can we create a CSS library that meets these needs and exceeds expectations?</h3>
    <p>By providing a comprehensive and modular CSS architecture, pre-designed components and layouts, and a focus on ease of use and customization.</p>
